# This is the official QuickCoords website code


## Why This Code is Public, But the App is Not
#### This code is public because itâ€™s a standard Vite + React setup, which doesn't contain any sensitive or proprietary information. In contrast, the app's code is kept private because it includes proprietary elements that I want to protect from competitors.

# Where is this code deployed
#### This code is deployed in github pages at: https://rodriveiga01.github.io/quickCoords_website/
